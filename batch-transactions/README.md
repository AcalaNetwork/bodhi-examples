# Bodhi.js Example - Batch Transactions (coming soon)
One of the advanced feature of EVM+, compared to traditional EVM, is the ability to do batch transaction.

This example will show how to batch transactions with polkadot wallet and [bodhi.js](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/bodhi.js/)ï¼Œso users can perform `approve` and `swap` transactions only with one single approve.

## Run
- start a dev server: `yarn dev`
- build: `yarn build`
- lint: `yarn lint`
